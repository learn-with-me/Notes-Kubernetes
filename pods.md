# Pods

Normally you take your application and convert it into a docker image, that becomes your portable runtime environment. Not only the application, but everything your application requires, has been packaged in the image. You can run any image as container.

A unit of deployment in terms of kubernetes is a pod. Typically you run one container per pod.
